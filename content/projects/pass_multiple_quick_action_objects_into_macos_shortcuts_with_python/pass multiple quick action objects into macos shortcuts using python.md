I have been using the [py-imessage-shortcuts](https://github.com/kevinschaich/py-imessage-shortcuts) python package to auto respond to text messages with chat GPT in my [iMessage Bot](https://github.com/SilasStokes/pymessage_gpt_bot). Now that openai has DALLÂ·E it would be nice to allow the bot to also be extended to include images; which py-imessage-shortcuts doesn't suport. After some experimentation I was able to figure out how to extend the package to allow images. It involves a trick I wasn't able to find online through googling so documenting it here in case someone else finds it useful. 


To start, the author of `py-imessage-shortcuts` found out that a cli command can be used to run a shortcut by name. Using that and Python's `subprocess` module, any shortcut can be run with:

```python
from subprocess import Popen
SHORTCUT_NAME = 'shortcut-name'
Popen([
    'shortcuts',
    'run',
    SHORTCUT_NAME,
])
```

Now to get input into shortcut, the `shortcuts` `man` page documents that it can take file input with the `--input-path` flag.

Which can be consumed in the shortcut by enabling `Use as Quick Action`

`py-imessage-shortcut` uses this to pass a dictionary to the `send-imessage` shortcut. Since the input has to be a file, first the package writes the dictionary to a json file which has its path passed to the `shortcuts` command using the `--input-path` flag. Then, in the Shortcuts App, the quick action input is set to type text. This allows the Quick Action Object to be parsed as a dictionary with the `Set variable` action. The `Set Variable` action needs the `to` clause is set to the key of the value to be extracted from the dictionary. Did that make sense? Here's the python and a screenshot from the shortcut:

```python
with open(TEMP_FILE_PATH, 'w') as f:
    message_details = {
        'recipients': recipients, 
        'message': message
        }
    json.dump(message_details, f)

Popen([
    'shortcuts',
    'run',
    SHORTCUT_NAME,
    '--input-path',
    TEMP_FILE_PATH,
])
```

So that's all the magic used in `py-imessage-shortcuts`. To extend it to allow images, simply send multiple `--input-path` clauses and enumerate them in the MacOS shortcut.  Here's the function I wrote in my [ pr to py-imessage-shortcuts ](https://github.com/kevinschaich/py-imessage-shortcuts/pull/4):

```python
def _dump_file(recipients: list[str], message: str) -> None:
    with open(TEMP_FILE_PATH, 'w') as f:
        message_details = {
            'recipients': recipients, 
            'message': message
            }
        json.dump(message_details, f)

def send_image(recipients: list[str], message: str | None, image_path: str) -> None:
    """enables an image to be sent from an absolute file path

    Args:
        recipients (list[str]): The phone numbers to address the iMessage to
        message (str | None): the message to send with the photo, if no message should be included, pass None
        image_path (str): file path to image, must be absolute
    """
    if len(message) == 0:
        message = None
    _dump_file(recipients, message)

    Popen([
        'shortcuts',
        'run',
        SHORTCUT_NAME,
        '--input-path',
        TEMP_FILE_PATH,
        '--input-path',
        image_path,
    ])
```

Then to get both the message and the image into Shortcuts, enable `images` in addition to `text` in the Quick Actions Input. The input can be treated as a List, where the order of the input objects is the same order as the `--input-path` clauses passed to the shortcuts cli command. So I used the `Get Item from List` action to separate the inputs and treat them individually as pictured by the full shortcut below:

![[final-send-image-shortcut.png]]

## Corner Cases:
Interestingly the `Send Message` shortcut action does not like empty strings; it will alert with an error saying that there's no value for it. I found that encoding Python's `None` value pairs well Shortcut's `if <variable> has any value` action.

The Quick Actions Input does not seem to enforce the type(s) you give in the Shortcuts GUI. The shortcut pictured above has no problem if only a text object is provided (omitting the image). 

## Dead end I explored on the way to this:
Initially I tried to just pass the path to the image within the existing dictionary py-imessage uses BUT shortcuts seems to be limited about where the `Get file from ____ at path ____` action can read the file/image from. If the image isn't in the iCloud shortcuts folder you'll get an error that reads : "Invalid file path The provided file path must be contained with the directory.". Which to combat I had to first copy the image to the iCloud shortcuts directory, and use that as the `file from` clause.

The error:
![[invalid-path.png]]

The fix:
```python
import shutil, os
file_name = './test_image.png'
icloud_shortcuts_dir = os.path.join(
        os.path.expanduser('~'),
        'Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~is~workflow~my~workflows/Documents')
shutil.copy(file_name, icloud_shortcuts_dir)

# then run the Popen cmd here
```
