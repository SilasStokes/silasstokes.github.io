I wanted something to exhaust the fumes from my 3d printer so I modeled some PVC pipe fittings in fusion 360 and used them to make an enclosure that's wrapped in vinyl. Ended up being MORE work than I thought it would be and worked LESS efficiently than I thought it would. I released the pipe fittings on [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/791506-34-pvc-pipe-fittings). Here's some images from the build:

I used a jig I found online to help make sure I was getting straigh cuts, [linked here](https://www.printables.com/model/284812-pipe-cutting-jig-32mm-pvc):

Vinyl came from shower curtains I bought at walmart:

Here's the final build. Definitely not airtight but I can audibly hear air being sucked in from the negative pressure.
